The platform allows members to log in, reserve courts under specific restrictions, and manage payments including annual fees, initiation fees, guest charges, and late penalties. The system includes role-based dashboards for members, treasurers, and admins. It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQLite. The platform is browser-based, requires an internet connection, and emphasizes usability for general users, while offering advanced features for admins and treasurers</p></div></div><!-- Project 2: Description Left, Carousel Right --><div class="project-row"><div class="project-desc"><h3>> <a href="https://github.com/NickBrownNH/MuscleForceCalculator">Muscle Force Calculator </a>&lt</h3><p>The Muscle Force Calculator is a Python-based application developed by myself and my research team at the University of Hartford to estimate the force exerted by the biceps during arm movements using real-time pose detection. Funded by NASA for the Connecticut Space Grant Consortium, the project utilizes the MediaPipe library to analyze body posture through a camera feed and calculate muscle force based on torque generated by the arm as a lever. Key factors for this to happen include the distance from the elbow to the hand and the bicep's attachment point, along with calculating the distance the person is from the camera while only using 2D visual data. The application features an augmented reality overlay that visualizes muscle forces in motion, making it a valuable tool for biomechanics education, physical therapy, sports science, and fitness training.</p></div><div class="project-carousel" id="carousel2"><img src="../imgs/project2-1.png" alt="Project 2 Screenshot" id="carousel2-img"><div class="carousel-controls"><button class="carousel-btn" onclick="prevSlide(2)">&#8592;</button> <button class="carousel-btn" onclick="nextSlide(2)">&#8594;</button></div></div></div><!-- Project 3: Carousel Left, Description Right --><div class="project-row"><div class="project-carousel" id="carousel3"><img src="../imgs/project3-1.png" alt="Project 3 Screenshot" id="carousel3-img"><div class="carousel-controls"><button class="carousel-btn" onclick="prevSlide(3)">&#8592;</button> <button class="carousel-btn" onclick="nextSlide(3)">&#8594;</button></div></div><div class="project-desc"><h3>> <a href="https://github.com/DerimB/CS351_TermProject/tree/testing">Chef Bot (Cooking Assistant Chat Bot) </a>&lt</h3><p>Chef Bot was a project made by myself and my teammate Derim Belica which is a cooking assistant powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to help users by suggesting recipes, providing detailed cooking instructions, and generating shopping lists. Built using both GPT-2 (via Hugging Face Transformers) and GPT-3.5 (through OpenAIâ€™s API), the bot was trained on the RecipeNLG dataset, though due to hardware constraints, only small subsets could be used locally for GPT-2 fine-tuning. The project integrates tools such as Python, Pandas for data handling, and dotenv for managing environment variables. While GPT-2 required extensive training and faced performance limitations, GPT-3.5 offered a more scalable and accurate solution through API integration. A custom GUI was developed to improve usability, and additional components like a keyword-based database scraper were implemented to enhance functionality. The project showcases some practical applications of LLMs in domain-specific tasks like culinary assistance.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
